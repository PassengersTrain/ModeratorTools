# About this plugin!
A Minecraft plugin for version 1.21.5 aimed to make server moderation easier.

# Commands
The plugin currently uses a subcommand system. The commands currently supported are listed below:

 ``` /moderatortools freeze <player> ```

 # Permission
The permission(s) required for a player to run certain commands or access specific features are listed below:
**These are subject to change sooner or later.**

```moderatortools.command.use ``` - Required to be able to execute the freeze command.

```moderatortools.moderation.broadcastmessage``` - Required to be able to receive notifications upon a player being frozen.

# Placeholders
This plugin currently **supports only** internal placeholders, which are:

```{suspected_player}``` - Replaces the frozen player’s name with the internal placeholder, making language file configuration much easier.

# Credits
I would like to thank these awesome developers!
